# DeepLearningAssignments
Assignments for course Deep Learning, CSE641, IIIT Delhi Winter 22

## Assignments
### 1. Perceptron, Madaline and Multi-Layer Perceptron. 
* Implement a Perceptron Training Algorithm and plot the decision boundaries for each iteration for AND, OR, NOT and XOR gate. 
* Implement Adaline and Madaline and train the madaline using the its greedy algorithm for the given data. 
* Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron in toolkit.py and optimizers including Gradient Descent, Momentum Optimizer, NAG, RMSProp, AdaGrad and ADAM. 

### 2. CNN and LSTM.
* Construct a CNN network to classify cell images into infected or uninfected using Pytorch.
* Design and Construct a pipeline using LSTMs to classify dialogues using Pytorch. We also study the impact of increasing context information in classification. 

### 3. Paraphrase Identification using DistilBERT.
* Design a pipeline to classify a pair of sentences as paraphrases. We also study the impact of freezing a few layers during training. 

## Instructions
